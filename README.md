[Flashcards](https://www.abefehr.com/flashcards/)
==========

While studying for a Religion midterm, I grew upset with the tools that currently exist for making flashcards and studying from them.

Of course, instead of actually studying, this lead to me creating this minimalistic, serverless flashcard viewer.

How to Use
----------

### Create cards

Simply create a text file on your computer that contains the cards' contents. Each card face is separated by 3 dashes, and in groups of two, they form cards.

    Front of card 1
    ---
    Back of card 1
    ---
    Front of card 2
    ---
    Back of card 2
    ---
    Front of card 3
    ---
    Back of card 3

When you want to study, simply drag and drop the text file onto the webpage and begin studying!

### Study

There's a simple set of keybindings you can use to study

|Key|Function|
|:-:|---|
|←|Move left in card deck|
|→|Move right in card deck|
|spacebar|Flip card over|
